        Moves at his own pace. People call it laziness; he calls it wisdom-in-motion.
        Keeps the peace in a neutral land and rarely speaks, but when he does, it lands.
        El Sloth spends most of its life quietly roaming forests, feeding on fruits and leaves, 
        and resting for long stretches of time. It is seldom seen, not because it hides, 
        but because its slow pace and simple habits make it easy to overlook. For many 
        in the Neutral Nation, spotting an El Sloth is less a sign of legend than a reminder that not all strength comes from speed or grandeur.
